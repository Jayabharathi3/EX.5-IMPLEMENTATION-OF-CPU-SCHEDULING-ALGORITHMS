# EX.5-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-CPU-SCHEDULING-ALGORITHMS

## AIM:
To implement First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) Scheduling

## ALGORITHM:

1. Start the process
2. Get the number of processes to be inserted
3. Get the value for burst time of each process from the user
4. Having allocated the burst time(bt) for individual processes , Start with the first
process from its initial position let other process to be in queue
5. Calculate the waiting time(wt) and turnaround time(tat) as
6. Wt(pi) = wt(pi-1) + tat(pi-1) (i.e. wt of current process = wt of previous process + tat of
previous process)
7. tat(pi) = wt(pi) + bt(pi) (i.e. tat of current process = wt of current process + bt of
current process)
8. Calculate the total and average waiting time and turnaround time
9. Display the values
10. Stop the process



## PROGRAM:
```C
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
	int bt[20],p[20],wt[20],tat[20],i,j,n,total=0,pos,temp; float
	avg_wt,avg_tat;
	printf("Enter number of process:");
	scanf("%d",&n);
	printf("\nEnter Burst Time:\n");
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		printf("p % d:",i+1);
		scanf("%d",&bt[i]);
		p[i]=i+1; //contains process number
	}
	wt[0]=0; //waiting time for first process will be zero
	//calculate waiting time
	for(i=1;i<n;i++)
	{
		wt[i]=0;
		for(j=0;j<i;j++)
		wt[i]+=bt[j];
		total+=wt[i];
	}
	avg_wt=(float)total/n; //average waiting time
	total=0;
	printf("\nProcess\t Burst Time \tWaiting Time\tTurnaround Time");
	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		tat[i]=bt[i]+wt[i]; //calculate turnaround time
		total+=tat[i];
		printf("\np%d\t\t %d\t\t %d\t\t\t%d",p[i],bt[i],wt[i],tat[i]);
	}
	avg_tat=(float)total/n; //average turnaround time
	printf("\n\nAverage Waiting Time=%f",avg_wt);
	printf("\nAverage Turnaround Time=%f\n",avg_tat);
}

```
